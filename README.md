This repository contain my code for trabalho pr√°tico de AED.

The code is partially functional in respect to matrix_add and matrix_multiply.

All other functions perform their tasks accordingly. 

matrix_add and matrix_multiply seem to share the same mistake, where when trying to add or multiply a row whith unmatching columns the operation gets mixed up.
